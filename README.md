# LITE: Light Inception with boosTing tEchniques for Time Series Classification

This is the source code of our paper "[LITE: Light Inception with boosTing tEchniques for Time Series Classification](https://germain-forestier.info/publis/dsaa2023.pdf)" accepted at the 10th IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics ([DSAA 2023](https://conferences.sigappfr.org/dsaa2023/)) in the  Learning from Temporal Data ([LearnTeD](https://dsaa2023.inesctec.pt/)) special session track. <br>
This work was done by [Ali Ismail-Fawaz](https://hadifawaz1999.github.io/), [Maxime Devanne](https://maxime-devanne.com/), [Stefano Berretti](www.micc.unifi.it/berretti/), [Jonathan Weber](https://www.jonathan-weber.eu/) and [Germain Forestier](https://germain-forestier.info/).

## The LITE architecture

The same LITE architecture is then used to form an ensemble of five LITE models, names LITETime.

## Usage of the code

To use this code, running the ```main.py``` file with the following options in the parsed as arguments:

```
--dataset : to choose the dataset from the UCR Archive (default=Coffee)
--classifier : to choose the classifier, in this case only LITE can be chosen (default=LITE)
--runs : to choose the number of runs (default=5)
--output-directory : to choose the output directory name (default=results/)
--track-emissions : to choose wether or not to track the training/testing time and CO2/power consumotion.
```

### Adaptation of code

The only change to be done in the code is the ```folder_path``` in the `utils/utils.py` file, this line. This directory should point to the parent directory of the UCR Archive datasets.

### Using [aeon-toolkit](https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon) to Train a LITETimeClassifier on your DATA

When using aeon, simply load your data and create an instance of a LITETime classifier and train it <br>

```
from aeon.datasets import load_classification
from aeon.classification.deep_learning import LITETimeClassifier

xtrain, ytrain, _ = load_classification(name="Coffee", split="train")
xtest, ytest, _ = load_classification(name="Coffee", split="test")

clf = LITETimeClassifier(n_classifiers=5)
clf.fit(xtrain, ytrain)
print(clf.score(xtest, ytest)
```

## Results

Results can be found in the [results.csv](https://github.com/MSD-IRIMAS/LITE/blob/main/results.csv) file for [FCN](https://github.com/hfawaz/dl-4-tsc/blob/master/classifiers/fcn.py), [ResNet](https://github.com/hfawaz/dl-4-tsc/blob/master/classifiers/resnet.py), [Inception](https://github.com/hfawaz/InceptionTime), [InceptionTime](https://github.com/hfawaz/InceptionTime), [ROCKET](https://github.com/angus924/rocket), [MultiROCKET](https://github.com/ChangWeiTan/MultiRocket), LITE and LITETime. For non-ensemble methods, results are averaged over five runs, for ensemble methods, we ensemble the five runs.

### Average performance and FLOPS comparison

The following figure shows the comparison between LITE and state of the art complex deep learners. The comparison consists on the average performance and the number FLOPS.
